Abstract:  
Central carbon metabolism of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was analyzed
using metabolic pathway analysis tools. Elementary flux modes for three
substrates (glucose, galactose, and ethanol) were determined using the
catabolic reactions occurring in yeast. Resultant elementary modes were used
for gene deletion phenotype analysis and for the analysis of robustness of the
central metabolism and network functionality. Control-effective fluxes,
determined by calculating the efficiency of each mode, were used for the
prediction of transcript ratios of metabolic genes in different growth media
(glucose-ethanol and galactose-ethanol). A high correlation was obtained
between the theoretical and experimental expression levels of 38 genes when
ethanol and glucose media were considered. Such analysis was shown to be a
bridge between transcriptomics and fluxomics. Control-effective flux
distribution was found to be promising in in silico predictions by
incorporating functionality and regulation into the metabolic network
structure.

Some typographical errors in the paper have been corrected:

  1. Reaction (49) has substrate NADcyt (rather than NADmit)
  2. Reaction (53) is missing products 90 NADPcyt
  3. CO2 and O2 are also set as external metabolites
